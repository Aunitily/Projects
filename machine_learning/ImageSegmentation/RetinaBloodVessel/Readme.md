#  Retina Blood Vessel Segmentation using UNet
### Author: Ben Hers
### Architecture: UNet using 4 Encoder/Decoder blocks
#### Dataset: The Stare Project
Upon starting into the field of using deep learning for biomedical imaging, I started by working
on different object detection and image segmentation tasks and one of the most popular
architectures was UNet. I happened upon the STARE project from UCSD in different biomedical image
segmentation papers on Arxiv so I decided to use this dataset as a fun/interesting dataset to try
different network architectures for image segmentation and the effect of different loss functions.
An example of the dataset is shown below.
