# Raspberry Pi Breakout Board
The idea for this project was to utilize the available pins to add a bunch of functionality to the Pi with a PCB that fits the form factor. This board has a full H bridge that allows you to drive DC motors. Also added is an IMU(LSM6DSLTR) that measures accleration as well as providing interfacing for an ultrasonic sensor.
